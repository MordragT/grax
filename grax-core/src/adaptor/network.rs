//! A network corresponds to a digraph
//! where each of the digraph’s edges is represented
//! by a pair of edges – the edge and its reverse edge.
//! Hence, the network shares the node set with the underlying graph
//! but has twice the number of edges.
//! Each digraph can be turned into an network.
